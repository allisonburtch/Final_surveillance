Watching You is a love story fabricated from tens of thousands of surveillance camera pictures. The cameras are on the ITP floor at NYU and were programmed using the open source language Processing. As an intersection between voyeurism and vulnerability, this piece questions the truth of surveillance. Though the images are from surveillance cameras, they seem innocuous. However, the audio is a transgressive, fearful paranoia, a kind of emotion that one doesn’t often share. The video rests in this ambiguity. At the ITP Winter Show, viewers were told that they were currently being surveilled. In exchange for me deleting one of their images from my computer, I would trade them an honest emotion - any sort of feeling, not necessarily about what they just watched, but just a personal emotion. I was surprised by the honesty I received. Many people didn’t care if I deleted their picture. —
